* Better handling of failed type writes ?

* Do better message if write() is attempted into an existing dataset

* Guard against user's writing /.* ?

* Keep sha -> object map in /.sha256 ?

* Only when writing a lattice object, check for chunk = { n, ....} in the options.
  If present, use it to set up chunk size.
